Your retirement years are closer than you think, so you want to build your wealth as early as possible to secure a financially comfortable future. Many turn to professional advisers for this, but at the end of the day, these people are just salespeople. Their traditional advice will never get you to the goal you want. They will simply sell you siloed tactics that are too good to be true, impossible to emulate, or only work for the rich. What you should be doing is becoming your own boss and investing money in passive investments.

 

Welcome to Money Ripples with Chris Miles. This show is your trusted guide in escaping the draining responsibility of working more than 40 hours a week and finally quit your 9-5 job.

 In this show, Chris breaks down how to start a passive source of income in the easiest ways. Discover the power of making your cash do the hard work for you. Increase your profits when you go after other money-making ventures, or even while you sleep! Win big through this strategy and unlock the incredible opportunity of making active work optional. 

Two decades later with more than 900 clients, Chris knows that cash-flowing assets are the way to becoming financially free. He was able to retire at 28 years old and is now teaching individuals and businesses about building wealth quickly and safely. 
Through his company Money Ripples, Chris exposes popular myths and presents an effective framework for passively achieving financial prosperity.
Chris invites you to take action right now. Secure that first good investment and financial growth will manifest one deal at a time.

Money isn't everything but money can change everything and not all of it is for the good. Quiet as it's kept, many entrepreneurs are struggling. Entrepreneurship frequently requires long and/or unpredictable hours which take a toll on relationships and all aspects of health including physical, mental, and sexual. Especially if you're a Black woman because you were probably carrying a high stress load even before you started your business! How often have you neglected your family, sleep, and basic self-care because you had to prioritize work? Did you have a resource for real conversations about how to navigate business when that same business is wreaking havoc in your life? If you're like way too many people in business, you probably suffer in silence and for the most part, wade through entrepreneurship trying to figure everything out on your own. But this ""go at it alone"" approach can end now. The SheConfidential podcast features conversations with Black entrepreneurs keeping it real about their wins and hurdles - both personal and professional. Guests share their life lessons and experiences so that you can achieve your business gains faster, with fewer losses and pains. These conversations will remind you that you're not alone and you're more prepared than you probably know. And most importantly, you will be energized and enlightened to make strategic moves that will put you on track to be part of the 25% of entrepreneurs whose businesses thrive 15 years or more. New episodes are released each Thursday on your favorite podcast app and YouTube.

I started my investing journey in 1998 while I owned and operated another successful business. Real estate was originally my side hustle. I invested part-time for about 10 years doing rehabs and picking up a handful of rentals before finally becoming a full-time investor. In 2008 when the market crashed, I became  an ""accidental wholesaler"".  (That was never my plan.)

Today, I help real estate investors create unforgettable brands and marketing plans that work!  

I also help people become an expert in one of the most lucrative niches on the planet, probate investing. I have been the leading probate investing expert for more than a decade, and I can make you an expert too. 

Whether you are a full-time investor or real estate is your “side hustle” for the time being, I can help you take your business to the next level.  If you’re ready to shave years off your learning curve you are definitely in the right place. These podcasts not only bring you information packed interviews, but also tools, tips and a whole lot of “how to” information to help you start or grow a successful real estate investing business.
